I am a first-year Masters in Robotics student at Carnegie Mellon University, with a BS in Mechanical Engineering from University of Maryland. My primary interest is Human Robot Interactions (HRI) and more specifically how a robot learner can improve even with a non-expert human teacher.

Currently, I am a member of the [HARP Lab](https://harplab.github.io/harplab.deploy/) and advised my Dr. Henny Admoni.
