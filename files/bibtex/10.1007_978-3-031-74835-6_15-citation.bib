abstract="As autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) increasingly operate in critical environments, ensuring their security and reliability becomes paramount. This paper presents a robust anomaly detection framework designed to enhance the resilience of CPS by integrating multiple sensor modalities, including Lidar, Odometry, and Network Traffic. Our approach leverages the strengths of each modality, compensating for potential weaknesses when individual modalities are considered in isolation. A vector-based reconstruction loss function is introduced, significantly improving the detection of subtle anomalies by preserving the contributions of individual features.",
